Mines/ @StrikTheCoder/ t.me/cryptodraining Scam.
Weirdo will keep begging you for money to fund his gambling addicition, has multiple fake sites and backdoors in the "drainer" that he resells from other people that don't even work. 

Mines on telegram @StrikeTheCoder  >< t.me/cryptodraining (don't trust its 100% a scam and the kid will probably say its competitor even if you send 50%/50% of the payment you will receive obfuscated code that doesn't work). 

He will suck you off till you pay btw thats how it is.
